# NABLEQ+
NABLEQ+ is an impractical assembly language designed with minimalism at its core.
Inspired by Subleq, it only has one operation, just instead of subtraction, it's an NAND (Nableq).
As that makes Nableq hard to use, NABLEQ+ adds several quality of life features, such as macros and a standard library.
